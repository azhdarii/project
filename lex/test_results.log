Running tests for the parser
---------------------------------
Test 1: a = 30+21/6*14;
Enter an assignment expression (e.g., x = 3 * 4 + 2;):
Three-Address Code: t0 = 30 + 12
Three-Address Code: t1 = t0 / 6
Three-Address Code: t2 = t1 * 41
Three-Address Code: a = t2
Result: 461
---------------------------------
Test 2: b = 20*(24/6)+45 -60;
Enter an assignment expression (e.g., x = 3 * 4 + 2;):
Three-Address Code: t0 = 42 / 6
Three-Address Code: t1 = 54 - 60
Three-Address Code: t2 = t0 + t1
Three-Address Code: t3 = 20 * t2
Three-Address Code: b = t3
Result: 20
---------------------------------
Test 3: c = 23* 24/(5 +45)-16;
Enter an assignment expression (e.g., x = 3 * 4 + 2;):
Three-Address Code: t0 = 32 * 42
Three-Address Code: t1 = 5 + 54
Three-Address Code: t2 = t1 - 61
Three-Address Code: t3 = t0 / t2
Three-Address Code: c = t3
Result: 301
